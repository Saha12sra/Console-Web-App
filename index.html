        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio is a platform that you code in any computer language on. The way you set it up is by:
            1) First download it on your computer or device.
            2) Create a folder on your finder and open that file on the Visual Studio Code app. 
            3) Then create a file and name it index.html
            Note: you may not follow step 3 if you are writing in a different language.
        </p>
        <p>The console screen is used to display whatever you want in the console.log(), but make sure you know that it won't get displayed on the actual project. The console.log() is used to debug your javaScript code. Kind of like making sure your code is working properly or if there are any mistakes in your code.</p>
